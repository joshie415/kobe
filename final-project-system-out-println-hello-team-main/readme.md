# Final Project
Create a full stack banking application. Starter code for front end, and back end found in sub folders. Use intelij to open back end, and vs code to open front end. Don't open root level folder or neither will work.

Each team to decide theme of app, and add 1 front end and 1 back end feature. Each team member should choose a new addition and add corresponding front and back end functionality to enable this.

Live demo on second to last day of class. Max 10 min per team, just showcase your newly added feature. Can continue committing up until last day of class.

Examples:
- request funds (invoice)
- favorites/friend list
- add message to transfer (like venmo)
- public transaction feed
